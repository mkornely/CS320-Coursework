# Lab 7: Web

## Debug Exercise

In addition to regular lab material (below), we'll now sometimes have
extra debug exercises.

Do a `git pull` on your VM to get the code [here](../debug/d6).  From
SSH (in the `d6` directory) run the following:

```
python3 main.py
```

There are two bugs in main.py.  See if you can fix them so that the
page keeps track of how many times the link is clicked.  These bugs
are similar to ones we've often seen in student code for P4, so
hopefully practicing now will save you time later.

## Lab Overview

In this part, you'll build a simple Flask game, called "Guess that
Function!".  You'll also learn `curl`; `curl` is like `cat`, but for
sending web requests instead of reading files.

We'll practice some parts in a notebook, then copy to a Flask application.

If you get confused about the directions about what to add to your
flask application, you can always peek at our complete version in
[solution.py](solution.py), but of course it's better practice to try to
figure it out on your own first.

## StringIO

In a notebook, paste+run the following:

```python
from io import StringIO
f = StringIO()
f.write("hello\n")
f.write("world!")
s = f.getvalue()
print(s)
```

A `StringIO` instance is what is known as a file-like object in
Python, meaning you can read/write to it (the "IO" part stands for
input/output).

This is handy when you want a string (which you can get with
`.getvalue()`) but you're dealing with a Python module that only works
with file objects, as in the next part.

## SVG

The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files are common on the web, and
can easily be mixed in with HTML (without even needing a separate
file).

In a notebook, let's try generating an SVG file.

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from io import StringIO

def get_ax():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))
    ax.set_xlim(-8, 8)
    ax.set_ylim(-8, 8)
    ax.spines['left'].set_position('zero')
    ax.spines['bottom'].set_position('zero')
    ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
    ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
    return ax

ax = get_ax()

# "save" to a string in the SVG format
f = StringIO()
ax.get_figure().savefig(f, format="svg")
svg_data = f.getvalue()

print(svg_data)
```

You should see something like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<!-- Created with matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) -->
<svg height="576pt" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 576 576" width="576pt" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
 <defs>
  <style type="text/css">
*{stroke-linecap:butt;stroke-linejoin:round;}
  </style>
 </defs>
 <g id="figure_1">
  <g id="patch_1">
   <path d="M 0 576 
L 576 576 
L 576 0 
L 0 0 
z
" style="fill:#ffffff;"/>
  </g>
  ...
```

Note that the above looks a bit like HTML; indeed, it can be inserted
directly into the middle of HTML.

## SVG in Flask

Start a new Flask app in a file named `guess.py`, pasting the following
(which is adapted from the example you just did in the notebook).

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from flask import Flask, request
from io import StringIO

app = Flask(__name__)

def get_ax():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))
    ax.set_xlim(-8, 8)
    ax.set_ylim(-8, 8)
    ax.spines['left'].set_position('zero')
    ax.spines['bottom'].set_position('zero')
    ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
    ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
    return ax

@app.route('/plot.svg')
def show_plot():
    ax = get_ax()

    # "save" to a string in the SVG format
    f = StringIO()
    ax.get_figure().savefig(f, format="svg")
    svg_data = f.getvalue()

    html = "<html><body><h1>Guess that function</h1>{}</body></html>"
    return html.format(svg_data)

# Be sure this if statement stays as the last thing in your .py!
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
```

Now, in a terminal, connect via SSH, and run the following:

```
python3 guess.py
```

It should look something like this:

<img src="run.png" width=400>

Now, ask whoever you're doing the lab with to go to
`http://your-ip:5000/plot.svg`, replacing `your-ip` with your VMs
public IP address.

They should see something like this:

<img src="browser.png" width=600>

## Guess Route

Add a function to your `guess.py` file, something like the following:

```python
def f(x):
    return -abs(x) # TODO: change this to your favorite mathematical function
```

Make `f` some sort of mathematical function, importing from the `math`
module if you like.  It doesn't matter what the function is.  The
"game" is that people will try to guess it.

Now, let's add a route so people can upload (POST) their guesses to
the server.  Paste the following in `guess.py` and restart the server
(kill it with `CTRL-C` before running `python3 guess.py` again).

```python
@app.route('/guess', methods=["POST"])
def guess():
    parts = request.get_data(as_text=True).split(",")
    x = float(parts[0])
    y = float(parts[1])
    actual = f(x)
    if actual == y:
        return "perfect\n"
    return "f({}) is {}, not {}\n".format(x, actual, y)
```

If you were to go to `http://your-ip:5000/guess` in your browser, you'll
see "Method Not Allowed", since web browsers generally use GETs (not
POSTs) when you first visit a page.

## POSTing with `requests`

Remember the `requests` module we learned in CS 220/301?  We can use
that to make guesses.  First import it:

```python
import requests
```

Then use it to send POST requests to your partners' web servers to see
if you can figure out their functions (`other-ip` should be whatever
they tell you their VM's IP address is):

```python
r = requests.post("http://other-ip:5000/guess", data="3,4")
r.raise_for_status()
r.text
```

You should get some output like this:

```
'f(3.0) is -3.0, not -4.0'
```

Or, if you're lucky:

```
'perfect'
```

Make a few guesses until you think you know their function, then check
with them.

## POSTing with `curl`

From another terminal, SSH to your VM, and run the following (again
replacing `other-ip` with that of your partners' IP addresses) --
watch the upper/lower case!

```
curl -X POST http://other-ip:5000/guess -d "3,4"
```

Here, `curl` is sending HTTP requests, using the `POST` method with
request body containing "3,4" (the part after `-d`).

`curl` is a quick and easy way to send web requests.  If you want to
do a GET request, it's even simpler:

```
curl http://other-ip:5000/plot.svg
```

That should dump out all the code for the SVG image.

## Plotting Guesses

Let's record guesses then plot them in `/plot.svg`.  Import pandas and
create a DataFrame for guesses (this code goes in `guess.py`):

```python
import pandas as pd

guesses_df = pd.DataFrame()
```

Now let's record guesses -- add the following to the `guess` function,
before the return statement:

```python
    idx = len(guesses_df)
    guesses_df.loc[idx, "x"] = x
    guesses_df.loc[idx, "y"] = y
    guesses_df.loc[idx, "actual"] = actual
```

Also, let's scatter the guesses and correct answers in the `show_plot` function:

```python
    if len(guesses_df):
        ax = guesses_df.plot.scatter(x="x", y="actual", c="black", s=60, ax=ax, zorder=1, label="actual")
        ax = guesses_df.plot.scatter(x="x", y="y", c="red", s=20, ax=ax, zorder=2, label="guess")
```

Restart your server, then ask your partner(s) to send you some
guesses, with `requests` or `curl`.  Then have somebody refresh the
`/plot.svg` page.  It ought to look something like this (red-on-black
dots represent correct guesses):

<img src="guess.png" width=600>

## Optional Fun

Ideas for making "Guess that Function!" even more fun:

* can you randomly pick a function when the server starts?
* can you give users scores, based on their average error?
* can you have a way to reset the guesses?
