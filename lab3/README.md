# Lab 3: Files and Complexity

Start a new notebook on your virtual machine, then complete the following three parts of the lab:

1. review [files and JSON](part1.md) -- mostly review before considering compressed files
2. compress [zip files](part2.md) -- save space and bundle files together
3. visualize [orders of growth](part3.md) -- get an intuition for what N and C mean

Have fun, and let us know if you have any questions!
